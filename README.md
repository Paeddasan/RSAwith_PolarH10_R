# RSAwith_PolarH10_R

This code is a beta version for the analysis of respiration using the integrated accelerometer in the Polar H10 sensor.
There is some false negatives in identifying inhalations and exhalations. This should be sorted out in the next steps.
Following that, the improved algorithm will be implemented in a Python script that directly pulls data from the sensor via Polar's SDK.
